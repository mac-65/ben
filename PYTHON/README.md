# Some Notes on Python Development on Windoz 11
This is not an expert guide, and may contain many errors or inefficiencies.

## Prerequisites (Markdown, atom, python, git/github):

### Markdown
Become familiar with the <code>Markdown</code> documentation language.<br>
https://github.com/lifeparticle/Markdown-Cheatsheet<br>
<code>Markdown</code> is the gold standard for anything github related - you
don't have to have a mastery of the language to produce decent looking documentation
(this README.md file gets by with the basics of the <code>Markdown</code> language).

### Install ‘atom’
https://github.com/atom/atom<br>

<code>Atom</code> as an IDE can do a lot of things, but I use it mainly as a <code>Markdown</code> previewer
as it has the reputation of closely matching how github will render a <code>Markdown</code> document.
There may be other <code>Markdown</code> previewers available so this is not a hard requirement.
Normally, I use <code>vim</code> in a KDE konsole terminal to edit text/source code file(s).

### Install ‘python’
